# How to use the Notebooks?

It's easy, you only need installed [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) in your machine. And configured in our favorite terminal.

Now we only need to install the conda environment with the folllowing command:

```
conda env create -f conda.yml
conda activate rl_course
python -m ipykernel install --name rl_course --display-name "rl_course"
```

And run the jupyter server!!!
